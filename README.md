# vim-config
This repository holds the configuration I use for Vim.

Most of the configuration was seen here [VIM and Python - a Match Made in Heaven](https://realpython.com/blog/python/vim-and-python-a-match-made-in-heaven/)

The base file (.vimrc file) has been created using this [vimrc file](https://github.com/j1z0/vim-config/blob/master/vimrc)

You can find your own .vimrc file in your home directory (~/.vimrc) and copy this configuration to that file.
